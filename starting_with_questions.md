USA contributed the most to the revenue.People from the Bay area and New York in the USA spend the most on most categories; this may be related to their income level?

Select distinct 

              all_sessions.v2productname,

From (
	SELECT DISTINCT *
	FROM analytics
	Where Revenue is NOT NULL
	) as alt
	
Join all_sessions 
Using (fullvisitorid)
GROUP BY v2productname,country,city
Order by revenue desc
